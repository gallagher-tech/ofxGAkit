| [ofxGAkit Repo](https://github.com/gallagher-tech/ofxGAkit) | [GA::kit Repo](https://github.com/gallagher-tech/GAkit/) | [Documentation](https://gallagher-tech.github.io/GAkit-doc/) |

`ofxGAkit` is the official openFrameworks addon for the `GA::kit` toolkit - G&A' in-house C++ toolkit for building interactive experiences.  
It provides your openFrameworks app with a full-featured 3D scenegraph, a powerful animation system, asset management, event handlers, layout utilities, and much more.

## Setup

Like most other oF addons, simply `git clone --recursive` this repo inside of your `openFrameworks/addons/` directory:

```sh
cd openFrameworks/addons
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gallagher-tech/ofxGAkit
```

_If you missed the `recursive` flag when cloning, use following command to get the GA::kit submodule:_

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then use the oF Project Generator to generate a project with `ofxGAkit` selected.

_Additionally, if you are looking for a development branch of `GA::kit`, use the following commands to checkout the desired branch after the steps above:_

```sh
cd libs/gaKit
git checkout [BRANCH_NAME]
```

**This addon has been tested to work on Windows 10/11.**

## [GA::kit](https://github.com/gallagher-tech/GAkit/)?

`GA::kit` is G&A's in-house C++ application framework for building interactive experiences.  
We use it to create anything from 2D UI prototypes to high-performance 3D immersive installations.

You can find more information and documentation [here](https://gallagher-tech.github.io/GAkit-doc/).
